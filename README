### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Languages I am learning:
    Python 6/10
    Java 6/10
    Swift 2/10
    Html 2/10
    Spanish 7/10

I am *almost* completely self-taught, so I know many specialized topics and how to get something to work, but not any jargon nor concepts that can be achieved via a homemade route.
I create numerous small hobby projects to push my skills and learn new things. 

FRC FTW!!!
